# Frogger 2 VSS Backup
This repository contains the end of project VisualSourceSafe backup of Frogger 2: Swampy's Revenge, from the file `FINAL 18042001.ssa`.  
It has been ported to git for convenience/accessibility purposes. The original backup is available as part of the Frogger 2 development archive release.  
Code history in the backup has been preserved and can be accessed with any git interface.  

## Compilation
While this repository contains full source backups for all versions of the game, making a setup to easily build the game would require heavy modification.  
Instead of modifying this repository (this repository is meant for easy access to commit history), separate repositories have been created with ready to compile versions of the game.
