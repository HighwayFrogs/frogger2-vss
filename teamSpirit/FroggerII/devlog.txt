	Morning:

	This morning, I spent some time covering over the stories, before forwarding them to Kev. He's definately coming up on thursday. 
	I also got a ping feature sorted so that networking takes into account latency... Got that stupid DPSim program working, so I simulate
	packet loss, latency, bandwith etc. Reminds me of the programs that used to eat CPU time, what useful things they were! 
	Started work on config file reader, added config.cpp & .h to the project, started devlog!
	Woo hoo.

	Afternoon:

	Finished off the config loading, and helped (and maybe hindered) Jim a bit on his procedural textures, got Richard to compile a concept
	package for kevin, Did a bit more on network support, and then decided that up until christmas I shall attempt to make the engine a bit smarter, 
	got ideas need to write them down and formulate them more. Spent time on xlu modes although I worry that other cards wont support them.

		
Andy Eder:
------------------------------------------------

	Morning:

	Spent the morning attempting to get the basic lab world level models and collision maps into
	(and running on) the N64. Still some artwork tasks need to be done on some of the lab levels.
	Entity and scripting will be added later - when it has been fixed (re: scripting).
	Dreaming of Cameron Diaz.

	Afternoon:

	Started looking into using procedural textures on the N64 for special effects and general
	aesthetic visual pleasantries. Considering using them as opposed to several hundred sprites
	for the special effects (such as vents). Why does the N64 have to be such a friggin' pain
	in the (_|_) ???? It's not exactly the most flexible platform to work on.
	Still dreaming of Cameron Diaz.


David Swift:
------------------------------------------------
	Spent part of the morning wrestling with the Orientate function - I'm sure
	there's a simpler way of performing this calculation. The maths eluded me
	once again.
	
	Fixed problems with Frogger facing the wrong direction on platforms (added
	a call to GetTilesMatchingDirection in CheckForFroggerLanding)

James Hubbard:
------------------------------------------------

	Morning:

	Fixed wierd flashing white effect on procedural texture palette.
	Tweaking of fire effect, worked on forcefield effect.
	Got a headache.

	Afternoon:

	Normal Dr Pepper is too sugary. Can we get some diet stuff please?
	Finished (for now) forcefield effect, discovered (with Matt) correct settings for 
	additive transparency, and moved loads of render state settings about. Started
	on water effect.


James Healey:
------------------------------------------------

	Bloody Memory!!!!
	Fixed a memory bug with file allocation, which was'nt being
	freed, I think most things are now being freed.
	
	Front end fully working and loading levels.

	Might dive into some special fx.
	

Mike Movel:
------------------------------------------------
	Fixed/frigged the direction of camera cases to work with the PSX mapping.
	
	Discovered that you have to set the total number of MALLOCS you can use in
	a program using the new PSX libraries - it's initially set to 512, but I had
	to change it to 1024 to allow everything to load.

	Tried to get plt4log and plt5log to load properly, but they don't seem to work. For now
	I'll just load a pltlilly instead.



Byron Blay:
------------------------------------------------
	Morning:
		Started converting new PC code.
		Just getting it to compile and link.

	Afternoon:
		Carried on converting new PC code.


Chris Wilson:
------------------------------------------------

	Morning:

	Did bugger all, 'cause I was in London.


	Afternoon:

	Started work on water rendering code.


	P.S. Can I have my ice cream and cakes now please?

08/12/99 - Wednesday
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Matt Cloy:
------------------------------------------------
	Morning:

		Spent much of the morning writing a piece of code to work out vertex normals on modgy/skinned objects.
		When I realised it was crap I threw it away.
		
		I also sorted Out mikes 3 month review form.

		This afternoon I processed the increasing number of things to do in my inbox, including some of the bugs that have been accumulating.

		I cant think straight today, maybe I'm getting the brain rot cold bug that Chris, Kevin, and Alex have had. Hope not.

		Fixed the bug with the frogs head, bloody dotproduct returning 1.000000000000001... grrr.		
		Fixed the bug with actor shadows, it was just using the fromtile, not the tile the nme is in!

Andy Eder:
------------------------------------------------

	Morning:

	Unable to wake from my dream about Cameron Diaz....I can't believe she did that for me !
	Today is National N64 Procedural Texture Day here in room Team Spirit. So...that's what
	I'm going to be doing today.

	Afternoon:

	Coughed loudly about 15:37 and thought it was funny, then carried on with the work from this
	morning. Got some nice flame effects working, although not quite the same way as they work
	on the PC. If only the N64 could support 4444 textures....I'll have to look into either using
	5551 RGBA (which means only 1-bit of alpha) or 8888 RGBA (which means we have 4 channels each
	of 8-bits for RGB and A). I think the 5551 is the best option and will provide transparency,
	and then use primitive modification functions to set the general translucency of the object
	on which the procedural texture appears.

	 	 ribbit

				Checked my frog facing code - it really does seem to work. Woohoo!
	/\OO/\		I'm working on Worldconv to accept triangles and those weird foldy-back polygon things
    |(  )|
	/\MM/\


James Hubbard:
------------------------------------------------
	Morning:

		New water ripple stuff, and new water palette (again)
		Considered pseudo-bumpmapping the water.

	Afternoon:

		First try at pseudo bumpmapping, looks kind of interesting. Spent
		inordinate amount of time working out how to divide by three without a divide.

	Late afternoon:

		Grr. Division by three I can do roughly by multiplying by (x<<6 + x<<4 + x<<2 + x)>>8
		and then discarding the fraction, but pseudo bump mapping doesn't seem to work that well anyway.
		Maybe applying specular hilights to single pixels and thin lines isn't too clever :)
		It ends up as a big mess of pixels. Bloody 32x32 textures, even voodoo1 can do 256x256...
		I'm going to stop doing procedural textures for a while and fix some bugs.

		Oh yeah, on that note I changed tile snappers to work better.

		I've had too much good coffee I think. Listened to completely random music 
		and laughed at Worldconv. Sandro is still trying to work out the title or a film from
		a vague memory of two women, a burglary, some noodles, and subtitles. Hmm.

		More from "Dear Diary" tommorrow

Mike Movel:
------------------------------------------------

	Morning:
		Began integrating mine and James' code changes. Quite a few problems.

	Afternoon:
		Helped Byron sort out the includes after taking incs.h out.


Byron Blay:
------------------------------------------------
	Morn:
		New conversion now compiling, not linking yet.
		C++ has given a few re-defs etc. that the C compiler did not pick up.
	Aft:

Chris Wilson:
------------------------------------------------
	Morning:
		Trying to work out where to put a water flag, so that we know that what we want to draw is a
		water object. Think I've just abput cracked it though.

	Afternoon:
