	Morning:

	This morning, I spent some time covering over the stories, before forwarding them to Kev. He's definately coming up on thursday. 
	I also got a ping feature sorted so that networking takes into account latency... Got that stupid DPSim program working, so I simulate
	packet loss, latency, bandwith etc. Reminds me of the programs that used to eat CPU time, what useful things they were! 
	Started work on config file reader, added config.cpp & .h to the project, started devlog!
	Woo hoo.

	Afternoon:

	Finished off the config loading, and helped (and maybe hindered) Jim a bit on his procedural textures, got Richard to compile a concept
	package for kevin, Did a bit more on network support, and then decided that up until christmas I shall attempt to make the engine a bit smarter, 
	got ideas need to write them down and formulate them more. Spent time on xlu modes although I worry that other cards wont support them.

		
Andy Eder:
------------------------------------------------

	Morning:

	Spent the morning attempting to get the basic lab world level models and collision maps into
	(and running on) the N64. Still some artwork tasks need to be done on some of the lab levels.
	Entity and scripting will be added later - when it has been fixed (re: scripting).
	Dreaming of Cameron Diaz.

	Afternoon:

	Started looking into using procedural textures on the N64 for special effects and general
	aesthetic visual pleasantries. Considering using them as opposed to several hundred sprites
	for the special effects (such as vents). Why does the N64 have to be such a friggin' pain
	in the (_|_) ???? It's not exactly the most flexible platform to work on.
	Still dreaming of Cameron Diaz.


David Swift:
------------------------------------------------
	Spent part of the morning wrestling with the Orientate function - I'm sure
	there's a simpler way of performing this calculation. The maths eluded me
	once again.
	
	Fixed problems with Frogger facing the wrong direction on platforms (added
	a call to GetTilesMatchingDirection in CheckForFroggerLanding)

James Hubbard:
------------------------------------------------

	Morning:

	Fixed wierd flashing white effect on procedural texture palette.
	Tweaking of fire effect, worked on forcefield effect.
	Got a headache.

	Afternoon:

	Normal Dr Pepper is too sugary. Can we get some diet stuff please?
	Finished (for now) forcefield effect, discovered (with Matt) correct settings for 
	additive transparency, and moved loads of render state settings about. Started
	on water effect.


James Healey:
------------------------------------------------

	Bloody Memory!!!!
	Fixed a memory bug with file allocation, which was'nt being
	freed, I think most things are now being freed.
	
	Front end fully working and loading levels.

	Might dive into some special fx.
	

Mike Movel:
------------------------------------------------
	Fixed/frigged the direction of camera cases to work with the PSX mapping.
	
	Discovered that you have to set the total number of MALLOCS you can use in
	a program using the new PSX libraries - it's initially set to 512, but I had
	to change it to 1024 to allow everything to load.

	Tried to get plt4log and plt5log to load properly, but they don't seem to work. For now
	I'll just load a pltlilly instead.



Byron Blay:
------------------------------------------------
	Morning:
		Started converting new PC code.
		Just getting it to compile and link.

	Afternoon:
		Carried on converting new PC code.


Chris Wilson:
------------------------------------------------

	Morning:

	Did bugger all, 'cause I was in London.


	Afternoon:

	Started work on water rendering code.


	P.S. Can I have my ice cream and cakes now please?

08/12/99 - Wednesday
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Matt Cloy:
------------------------------------------------
	Morning:

		Spent much of the morning writing a piece of code to work out vertex normals on modgy/skinned objects.
		When I realised it was crap I threw it away.
		
		I also sorted Out mikes 3 month review form.

		This afternoon I processed the increasing number of things to do in my inbox, including some of the bugs that have been accumulating.

		I cant think straight today, maybe I'm getting the brain rot cold bug that Chris, Kevin, and Alex have had. Hope not.

		Fixed the bug with the frogs head, bloody dotproduct returning 1.000000000000001... grrr.		
		Fixed the bug with actor shadows, it was just using the fromtile, not the tile the nme is in!

Andy Eder:
------------------------------------------------

	Morning:

	Unable to wake from my dream about Cameron Diaz....I can't believe she did that for me !
	Today is National N64 Procedural Texture Day here in room Team Spirit. So...that's what
	I'm going to be doing today.

	Afternoon:

	Coughed loudly about 15:37 and thought it was funny, then carried on with the work from this
	morning. Got some nice flame effects working, although not quite the same way as they work
	on the PC. If only the N64 could support 4444 textures....I'll have to look into either using
	5551 RGBA (which means only 1-bit of alpha) or 8888 RGBA (which means we have 4 channels each
	of 8-bits for RGB and A). I think the 5551 is the best option and will provide transparency,
	and then use primitive modification functions to set the general translucency of the object
	on which the procedural texture appears.


David Swift:
------------------------------------------------
	 	 ribbit
		/
				Checked my frog facing code - it really does seem to work. Woohoo!
	/\OO/\		I'm working on Worldconv to accept triangles and those weird foldy-back polygon things
    |(  )|
	/\MM/\


James Hubbard:
------------------------------------------------
	Morning:

		New water ripple stuff, and new water palette (again)
		Considered pseudo-bumpmapping the water.

	Afternoon:

		First try at pseudo bumpmapping, looks kind of interesting. Spent
		inordinate amount of time working out how to divide by three without a divide.

	Late afternoon:

		Grr. Division by three I can do roughly by multiplying by (x<<6 + x<<4 + x<<2 + x)>>8
		and then discarding the fraction, but pseudo bump mapping doesn't seem to work that well anyway.
		Maybe applying specular hilights to single pixels and thin lines isn't too clever :)
		It ends up as a big mess of pixels. Bloody 32x32 textures, even voodoo1 can do 256x256...
		I'm going to stop doing procedural textures for a while and fix some bugs.

		Oh yeah, on that note I changed tile snappers to work better.

		I've had too much good coffee I think. Listened to completely random music 
		and laughed at Worldconv. Sandro is still trying to work out the title or a film from
		a vague memory of two women, a burglary, some noodles, and subtitles. Hmm.

		More from "Dear Diary" tommorrow

James Healey:
------------------------------------------------

	Pressie day!!!!

	Had a look at why the frog is falling through the world some times, maybe it's the collision.
	Probably the very old frog code that we have, I can recall a frog falling problem from the pc.

	Will go through and fix the right anim numbers for the frog, I think animateActor is commented out!!!

Mike Movel:
------------------------------------------------

	Morning:
		Began integrating mine and James' code changes. Quite a few problems.

	Afternoon:
		Helped Byron sort out the includes after taking incs.h out.


Byron Blay:
------------------------------------------------
	Morn:
		New conversion now compiling, not linking yet.
		C++ has given a few re-defs etc. that the C compiler did not pick up.
	Aft:

Chris Wilson:
------------------------------------------------
	Morning:
		Trying to work out where to put a water flag, so that we know that what we want to draw is a
		water object. Think I've just abput cracked it though.

	Afternoon:
		Got the PSX to draw water.

09/12/99 - Thursday
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Matt Cloy:
------------------------------------------------

	Spent most of today with kevin, the time I didnt spend in the meeting I spent eiter preparing for it,
	or working on / talking about this Taz thing

Andy Eder:
------------------------------------------------

	Morning:

	Go on - have a guess what I've been working on ! Ok, I'll tell you anyway. I've been working
	on the procedural texture stuff again. It now works using 5551 RGBA so some of the nice alpha
	blending effects of the PC cannot be done on the N64, but it still looks good N64 stylee.
	Started to rewrite the procedural texture creation routines to handle the 5551 format, then
	realised about an hour later that BankManager already does this anyway ! Ok, so I forgot...

	Afternoon:

	Basically carried on with the mornings activities....



David Swift:
------------------------------------------------
	Fixed WorldConv to handle triangular collision tiles. God the ASE file
	format is a pile of puppy doo-doo. Never ever use it again.
	Also optimised the checks a lot so it's hugely faster. Except it didn't
	quite work, so I've got to figure out where it's going wrong.

James Hubbard:
------------------------------------------------

	Morning:
		Rewrote sinking tile state. Bug fixes to procedural textures,
		and a fix to FindJoinedTileByDirection so it can span join tiles.
		May have to put it back again if it breaks other things.

	Afternoon:
		Fixed shadows a bit, so they work on non path-based enemies. Had some more coffee
		so I made a candle flame and a steam/smoke effect that can be activated by a toggle.
		Did some other stuff too but I'm writing this on Friday so I can't remember.



James Healey:
------------------------------------------------

	Spent most of the day helping Chris with water, only to find out I was updating the wrong
	texture bank, so nothing was working, we got it working and now chris is trying to modge the verts.

	Also changed a few things in our obe to froggger map converter that Fred wrote, ok so we want to
	times a float by 128 to get a psx value, but the float being read from the obe file thing was cast to
	an int before I could use it, so 0 or 1, I don't think so.

	Got upset coz we are being turfed out of this room and back I with Andrew, I will miss the lard runs, by resident lard man John!!!


Mike Movel:
------------------------------------------------
	Morning:
		Carried on helping Byron with the includes.

	Afternoon:
		Finished integrating James' code, but there are still a few problems.


Byron Blay:
------------------------------------------------
	Code compiles and links.
	Removed incs.h and fixing resulting errors,
	(this is so that we can work quickly without full remakes)


Chris Wilson:
------------------------------------------------


	Morning:
		This morning my computer crashed (needing rebooting)* three times, and it took me all morning just
		to get the bloody PSX to render my water objects properly. There was also a bug in frog_map.exe
		which James fixed. I've been experimenting with u/v texture animation. It's a pain in the arse.

	Afternoon:
		Much the same sort of stuff. Now I'm going to play with animating the water's actual vertex
		positions.  


*In my vocabulary, there are two kinds of machine hangs:

1.	A 'Crash of the Gods' is typically a blank screen or screen corruption, with the machine not responding
	thus requiring a complete reset.

2.	A 'Crash of the Titans', is less severe, the screen is still recognisible, but the machine will still
	require a reset.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Matt Cloy:
------------------------------------------------

	Did some stuff with jims proc-textures in hub/frontend, got an additive mode in for objects (more generic) and fixed 
	vertex alphas so that they actually work now. Talked about next-gen in general.

	Morning:

	She's alright...but she's no Cameron Diaz (unfortunately).
	I spent my morning drawing using ASCII characters....allegedly. Not true, I tell you.

	News from Matt and Kevin that the N64 version has been put on hold for a couple of
	months. So, just been working on tidying up what we do have on the N64 and getting
	it into a presentable state should anyone wish to 'view' it.

	Afternoon:

	Same as this morning - general wrapping up of N64 version for the forseeable future.

	Fixed the bug with WorldConv so it's producing proper output - I was
	averaging points from the same triangle twice, rather than both tris
	of the quad. Working on handling complex collision for perpendicular
	join tiles.


James Hubbard:

	Morning:
		Talked tech for a long time. Umm. I think I fixed a bug too, but I can't
		remember really. Oh yeah, tried bump mapping with a different algorithm. Seems
		better.

	Afternoon:
		Got bump mapping working on water ripples, but the light source is visible as a
		huge circle, and it's still a 32x32. Looks like sunlight off water, without the water.
		And with your eyes squinted. 

	Later:
		Oh bugger it, I can't get rid of that sodding circle. If anyone's interested, it's
		called ProcessPTWaterRipplesBM, in ptexture.c
		No practical use at this point, I'm going to go back to game code for a while.

	Finally got those wasp's orientate correct,
	also other enemies are correct for direction of movement.

	Any only in about 4 lines of code, I suppose it helps, when there
	is a function that calcs the angle for you, hehe!!!

	some thing doggy going on with collision with wasp's, not really
	sure what!!!

Mike Movel:
------------------------------------------------
	
	Decided to try to redo the code involved with the playstation's 3D coordinate 
	system, in order to allow the rest of the gamecode to stay the same as the PC's.
	At the moment, a lot of the code throughout the game needs to be altered in 
	various ways to make it work.


Byron Blay:
------------------------------------------------

	- #includes finished.
	- Converted many VECTORS to SVECTORS and FVECTORS, using past experience,
	- Duplicating functions as needed (e.g AddVectorSS(), AddVectorVV() e.t.c)
	- Spent some time with Mike on the PC/PSX coordinate systems.

David Swift:

	Fixing bugs in the frog movement code:
	
	o Stop jumping into barred tiles through join tiles
	o Queue "landed" animation if a jump fails (fixes the wierd handstand thing)
	
	Trying to fix the double-jump bug, but right now I'm waiting on game.c for the
	controller processing part.
	
	Subtle puzzling bug in WorldConv has appeared, related to my new adjacent-tile
	test. I'm looking into it.
