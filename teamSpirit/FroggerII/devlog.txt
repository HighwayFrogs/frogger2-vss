	Morning:

	This morning, I spent some time covering over the stories, before forwarding them to Kev. He's definately coming up on thursday. 
	I also got a ping feature sorted so that networking takes into account latency... Got that stupid DPSim program working, so I simulate
	packet loss, latency, bandwith etc. Reminds me of the programs that used to eat CPU time, what useful things they were! 
	Started work on config file reader, added config.cpp & .h to the project, started devlog!
	Woo hoo.

	Afternoon:

	Finished off the config loading, and helped (and maybe hindered) Jim a bit on his procedural textures, got Richard to compile a concept
	package for kevin, Did a bit more on network support, and then decided that up until christmas I shall attempt to make the engine a bit smarter, 
	got ideas need to write them down and formulate them more. Spent time on xlu modes although I worry that other cards wont support them.

David Swift:
------------------------------------------------
	Spent part of the morning wrestling with the Orientate function - I'm sure
	there's a simpler way of performing this calculation. The maths eluded me
	once again.
	
	Fixed problems with Frogger facing the wrong direction on platforms (added
	a call to GetTilesMatchingDirection in CheckForFroggerLanding)

James Hubbard:
------------------------------------------------

	Morning:

	Fixed wierd flashing white effect on procedural texture palette.
	Tweaking of fire effect, worked on forcefield effect.
	Got a headache.

	Afternoon:

	Normal Dr Pepper is too sugary. Can we get some diet stuff please?
	Finished (for now) forcefield effect, discovered (with Matt) correct settings for 
	additive transparency, and moved loads of render state settings about. Started
	on water effect.


James Healey:
------------------------------------------------

	Bloody Memory!!!!
	Fixed a memory bug with file allocation, which was'nt being
	freed, I think most things are now being freed.
	
	Front end fully working and loading levels.

	Might dive into some special fx.
	

Mike Movel:
------------------------------------------------
	Fixed/frigged the direction of camera cases to work with the PSX mapping.
	
	Discovered that you have to set the total number of MALLOCS you can use in
	a program using the new PSX libraries - it's initially set to 512, but I had
	to change it to 1024 to allow everything to load.

	Tried to get plt4log and plt5log to load properly, but they don't seem to work. For now
	I'll just load a pltlilly instead.
